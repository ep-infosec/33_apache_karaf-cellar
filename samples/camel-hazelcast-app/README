Camel Hazelcast App is a sample application that demonstrate the usage of the camel-hazelcast component with Cellar
to provide remote communication between Camel routes.

Use Case
--------
The producer bundle periodically (every 5 seconds) create a message "Hello Cellar" and send it into the distributed
Hazelcast/Cellar queue "yet.another.queue".
On the other hand, the consumer bundle consumes the messages from the "yet.another.queue" Hazelcast queue and display
the message body in the log file

Installation
------------
To show the remote Camel routes communication, your Cellar cluster should contain at least two nodes.

NodeA
-----
On NodeA, we install the Camel blueprint and hazelcast features:

karaf@root()> feature:repo-add camel
karaf@root()> feature:install camel-blueprint
karaf@root()> feature:install camel-hazelcast

We can now install the producer bundle:

karaf@root()> bundle:install -s mvn:org.apache.karaf.cellar.samples.camel.hazelcast/producer/3.0.0

The Camel producer route starts automatically.

NodeB
-----
As for NodeA, we install the Camel blueprint and hazelcast features on NodeB:

karaf@root()> feature:repo-add camel
karaf@root()> feature:install camel-blueprint
karaf@root()> feature:install camel-hazelcast

We can now install the consumer bundle:

karaf@root()> bundle:install -s mvn:org.apache.karaf.cellar.samples.camel.hazelcast/consumer/3.0.0

The Camel consumer route starts automatically.

On the NodeB log, using log:tail, we can see the messages "coming" from NodeA.
